I am currently working in CSIR National Chemical Laboratory. I graduated from the University of Delhi with a major in Physics in 2021 and from Central University of Punjab with a masters in Computational Physics in 2023.
I am interested in how computation can help advance science. Currently I am working on LLMs and their applications in material science and chemistry. I am extremely passionate about open-source and open-science, and I actively learn and try to contribute and share what I learn.
